## Extending DevOps

- Ops wants to create predictable environments
- Dev wants to be agile, and experimental
- In order to achieve that
  - We need to throttle work
    - So we can have room for tech debt
- Where does legacy fit in?


- How do you tackle Technical Debt?
  - 20% of time to tackle didn't work out
  - Creating a game of if can help form a co-hort
  - Instead of using 20% time. Take 1 sprint in 5 to do technical debt.
  - Example from avalon where they would increase the amount of tech debt to tackle over time.


## Tips

- How to track dev and/or Opus tech debt?
