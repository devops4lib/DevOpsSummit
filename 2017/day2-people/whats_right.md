# What's right for our organization?

- How do we make sure that we don't just copy what other organizations are doing?
- Is their a difference between Big and Small


## Diff between Big and Small

- It's hard to run open source solutions as a small staff
  - But, it's hard for large organizations as well
    - Scale cause that issue

- The number of machines you run isn't a strong differentiator

- Digital Libraries are always understaffed at all sizes

- Because everyone is overtasked
  - Can't hire enough to keep up with work
  - They continue to bring problems in the front door
- Just because hiring capacity is different, there is still always this fact that people are always out matched.

- **Understaffed && Overtaxed**

- It sounds like in general Digital Libraries are doing some of the same work

- Maybe if the community solves the problems
  - Large organizations can help small organizations

## Easy/Simple/Complicated/Complex

- When does it make sense to invest in a complex solution
  - Scale, your simple solutions doesn't scale

- But, maybe if we breakdown solutions in to parts that can be recombined

- Right now, for existing digital library solutions things are so specific for each 

## What makes us successful Digital Library

- We don't know
- But it's gotta be cheap and sustainable because we move on so often
