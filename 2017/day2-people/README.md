+
* Tooling day was useful and learned a lot about things we didn't know about
* Github Repo +
* Unstructured free-form discussions
* Face to face meeting helpful
* Positive atmosphere
  * People were communicative and talkative
* Stories with concrete examples allowed for more productive conversation
* Structure of the days worked well
* Report backs helped with having to have a split track days
* Not too many sessions
* Talks grounded in deliverables
* Dedicated on just DevOps helped to focus the conversations
* Two days is the correct length
* Catering helped to continue conversation and alleviated worry for the day

∆

  * bottled water or spring water for containers
* Public library representatives
