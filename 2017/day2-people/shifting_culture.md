# Shifting Culture

## How can we organize the conversation

- Metrics/Measurements
- Business Purpose/ Non-tech language
  - Articulating Shared Goals
  - "Infrastructure as code"
    - This helps us achieve our shared Goals
- Goal settings across org
- Then following in up with communicating
- What do we have culture, and what are we shifting culture too?
- How do we create room for failure
- Share examples of Culture Change

## Deliverables

- Talking points, showing how we work
  - Helps people communicate

- Entering into moments of change with an open mind
  - We think this might work
  - Understanding what your goals are and seeing if your solution lives up to your goals
  - Owning that success, following up with success

- Charateristics
  - Small, lightweight, achievable
  - Check in on 'tech' intution
    - Does the goal 'feel good'
    - Allow mistakes to be made
  - Allow reassessment of the process
  - Process it self encourages team building
    - Code review, pairing, etc
  - Know your audience/scope

- Building a team of change
  - It can be hard to push for change
  - Getting other people to help

- Be Strategic
  - Fold in current culture
  - Build a co-hort
    - Will help in the long term

- Ask how the work feels
  - What can we do to make the work feel better
  - Does it feel better?
    - Success

- There needs to be a way to back out of something you are trying
  - That lessen's the burden on stakeholders
  - We don't have to invest in changing everything

- How do you engage in culture change, without putting people on the defensive
  - You can't really engage in that process, if you don't understand your own emotional state
  - Why do you feel defensive, why would they feel defensive?

- Creating time and space for sharing mental models
  - Being on the same page increase's efficiency
  - Create forcing functions for sharing mental models
    - Code Review

- Define goals
  - Have empathy for other stakeholders
    - Ask question
    - Find out what concerns them
  - Fold in the stakeholders concerns

- Appropriate Work for Appropriate People
  - Makes everyone more efficient
  - Sometimes can be helpful framework

- Establishing a Shared Understanding

## Stories

### Good Examples

- Bepress
  - CI/CD
    - No release process
    - Didn't feel done
    - Forgot to communicate with product
    - But, in the end much better
  - Retro's
    - Didn't have

- UCLA (Kevin)
  - We had shell scripts
  - Ops wanted to use Puppet
  - Dev wanted to use ansible
  - Dev asked if they could try ansible
    - Can we do some small stuff
    - Had some success with the small stuff
  - Those small success's lead to growth of Ansible
  - Now use ansible instead of puppet

- Kate
  - Didn't feel like one way or another about Docker
  - A few were people very passionate about docker
  - Dev's joined the people that were passionate
  - So, they through them selves into the project
  - They could commiserate with one other developers

- Francis
  - I use ansible, hard to convince me of not using ansible
  - Has worked at multiple organizations
  - They were trying to do puppet
  - But, they seemed to be hiding a wall with puppet, or were tired
  - By using ansible instead of puppet, you are creating a more inclusive tool
  - It's easier to get support from others

- MIT (Jeremy)
  - Code review
  - Any project we do code review it's successful in production
  - Code review can be a forcing function to get people on the same page
  - Code review is a simple forcing function

- How do you find time to make things better
  - Things are invisible until they are broken
  - Set constraints before hand
  - Asking what do you (business/product)

- Embracing reality, and providing hope
- Being right, isn't being effective


### Not great stories

- Temple (Chad)
  - Wanted to get ops to help do steps
  - Created examples on ansible
  - Person had another way to do something
  - Ansible solution didn't fit into their world view

- Kieran
  - Had to go from problem to problem
    - was exhausting
  - Wanted to get some time to fix problems
  - Got people in the room to talk about problems
    - Listened to everyone, got stakeholders
  - Final solution, wasn't one originally thought, but worked out for everyone

- Francis
  - Can't always deal with everyone
  - Couldn't ever get there
  - Asked another person to communicate on your behalf

- Standford (Tony)
  - We have technical SLAs
    - Will wake up people at appropriate times
  - Have to have discussion about update, and downtime
  - Also have a need for backups
  - But, we don't know how long we should keep data

- Alex (bepress)
  - Tried to use a culture survey
  - But, I can't seem to get any value of this

- Kieran
  - Was constantly putting out fires
  - Wen't to boss, and said
    - I think I could work better if I try to understand what other people are trying to get down.
  - Started doing semi-regular pizza parties
    - What are you looking forward to?
    - What technologies are interesting to you?
  - Made people happy
  - But, furthermore it led to making it easier to get people too create a strategic plan
