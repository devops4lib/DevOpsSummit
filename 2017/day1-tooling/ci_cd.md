- What does every do?
  - Stanford
    - CI
      - Travis CI
        - Tied up to PR and Merges
      - Starting an APP to give us deployable status of repos
    - Automated Deploys
      - Mostly automated deploys
      - With Capistrano
  - UCLA
    - Using Jenkins
      - 3 branches test/stage/prod
      - test on merge
      - stage on tag
      - prod on bush button
    - Want to use Travis
      - Concerns about Hosted services
      - More comfortable with Saas
    - Artifacts on S3
  - DCE
    - Travis for CI
    - Capistrano for Deployments
    - The future
      - Automated CD from Travis
      - gonna use an EIP to do blue green
  - UMD
    - Trying to do more CI/CD
    - No CD at this point
    - No automated deployments
    - Deployment are human based
    - A little bit of Jenkins
      - Hosts the Fedora community
      - Uses SonarQube
    - Because of Fedora, we want to do CI our through Jenkins
  - bepress
    - New stuff
      - Newer applications have deployment pipeline to production
      - Every commit is a release canidate
      - Developers push deploy button
    - Old Stuff
      - slow migration from Run Book based deployments
      - Nowadays we use ansible for deployments
      - CircleCI for Ci
  - Virginia Tech
    - Lots of ansible for deployments
    - No CI
    - Using Servers, so do CI to serverless
- What's the future
  - On demand deploys for on prem
    - How do you wire up all the infrastructure and packages
    - It's hard
    - Looked at Heaven as one example
  - How do you do this better with out a bunch more 
  - DCE
    - Uses ansible to self bootstrap
    - Last step of ansible is to run
      - next to left cap self
      - Add's all the ruby stuff
  - On prem could be really difficult
    - Needs git
    - Needs cap
    - Needs heaven
  - GitFlow
    - UMD
      - Uses Gitflow
      - Peter likes it
      - Most developers on board
      - Learning curve for developers
      - If you are gonna use GitFlow use it earlier rather later
      - Gitflow was top down
        - But not many people to convince
