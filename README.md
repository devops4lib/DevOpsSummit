This repo holds planning documents and breakout notes for the DevOps 4 Libraries Summit.

## DevOps4Lib Summit

See https://www.library.upenn.edu/events/devops4lib-2024 for 2024 event information and registration!

The DevOps4Lib Summit is a 2-day unconference held for discussion and problem
solving around devops culture and technical topics such as deployment,
continuous integration, observability, incident response, and secrets
management.

Originally hosted at Princeton University, we've also been hosted in Philadelphia, PA by the University of Pennsylvania and the Science History Institute. The summit was held annually for several years until a global shift to virtual work and events led to a hiatus for this event.

Group size has been 15-40 people.

With the exception of the fully virtual May 2020 meeting, the DevOps4Lib Summit is held as an in-person-only event. Organizers recognize the trade-offs made in this decision, including:
* An increased sense of community and trust makes it easier discuss problems and challenges
* Decreased access to the meetings
* Decreased hosting requirements and a lower event cost for attendees

To offset the drawbacks around access, we assign note takers at every session and ensure that the notes are then added to this repository. We also hope that other code4lib affiliated institutions and individuals will host similar meetings in different regions.

During this event please expect some extra use of the code4lib#devops slack channel as attendees coordinate with one another.

## Unconference Process

We gather together to brainstorm topics we want to discuss. Then we vote on each one, with each participant voting as many times as they want. The group works together, with a facilitator, to determine which topics should be plenary and which should be broken into smaller / parallel tracks.

Everyone should come ready to participate by sharing problems and/or solutions.

## Other communication channels
### Slack channel
Our primary mode of communication is the #devops channel in the [code4lib slack org](https://code4lib.org/irc/).

### Monthly (remote) meetings
We have had some zoom calls on special topics, notes from those are in their own
repo: https://github.com/devops4lib/meetings

### Mailing List
We had a mailing list for a while but it is no longer in active use. For email
announcements we use the code4lib email list.

To join the mailing list
* Type listserv(at)princeton(dot)edu in the To: box.
* Delete the signature line from the body of the email if it is included automatically.

### Blog
https://devops4lib.github.io/
Created during one of our summits and still awaiting content, we hope this blog
will be a place for community members to share problems and solutions, large and small. Contribute at https://github.com/devops4lib/devops4lib.github.io/

## Participant institution github repos

We've generated an alphabetical listing of [Github Repositories](github_repositories.md) so that we can easily browse one another's work.
