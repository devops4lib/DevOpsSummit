### Management

  * Example of a problem in management or debt management
      * People start an exciting new program and let you know about it, but there is little discussion about what success means for the project.
      * What techniques are there to help here?
      * How do we encourage people running projects to define: What is success?
      * An idea: raise awareness of what good practices exist
      * Is the project done?
      * Do we keep metrics for what constitutes success
      * Building out a project charter with success criteria in a greenfield
      * Project manager with an infrastructure set up to create a charter
      * More or less formal process
      * we have an Impact assessment and organizational analysis team
      * Project charter for every projects (success criteria, timeline)
      * Project vs program manager (librarians, stakeholders, tech people)
      * A roadmap at the division level
      * When the project has been completed:
      * Trying to add metrics and capacity of the technology team. Having project managers work with the technology teams has been extremely rewarding
      * Distinction between what success means for stakeholders vs developers
      * Used MVP (minimum viable product) as a criteria. The Minimal criteria is constantly is expanding and never compressing
          * Still recommend using MVP despite the shortcomings
       * Poorly defined specs are a big problem.
       * A vision statement for a team. Which defines success
       * Write the documentation  (for the product?) ahead of time, schedule the time as part of the process
       * Silos processes / teams vs general purpose programmers (prevents territorial scheduling of team)
       * The ability to say no in an organization during cultural transitions
       * Teams with a mix of people (stakeholders + developers + librarians)
       * HPP (Highest Paid Person) decision making tree are a point of frustration
       * A way to address the lack of clear requirements is to send people to product owner training
       * What is a product owner (PO)?
           * In Agile the PO holds the vision for the project
           * What problem are we solving
           * Keeps tabs on requirements and conflicting priorities
           * Developers participating in the training is helpful to gain more awareness of the process
      * Vision and value statement for the team that is reevaluated annually is valuable to see if we are meeting our goals as a team and see what needs to change
      * Libraries are not used to trusting that the problem will be revisited and this makes the scope creep a constantly recurring problem
      * Help them understand we will still be here after
      * Project fail because they are done (i.e. never updated, upgraded, improved)
      * How do we codifying on going commitment to projects
      * Have operational agreements when the project wrap up and transfers to the operations team
      * A way to tackle the “done” project is quarterly enhancements to existing projects (reports go out to parties interested: managers, archivist, people in the charter of the project)
      * Q. How do we help product owners
      * Q. How do we protect capacity.
      * Our systems are not going to last forever….
      * Document/think what happens when we replace a system
      * 
 ###   Technical debt
 
  * How to quantify your technical debt?
      * Using a percent of time (e.g. 20% of your time towards technical debt)
  * How long does it take to take out of technical debt? E.g six years to update everything
  * There are some tools that grade this
      * The groan meter for how much developers wanted to join projects
      * [Codeclimate](https://codeclimate.com/quality) will measure how much (but doesn’t account for everything, just “code quality”)
  * People have more than one project that they participate in
      * All projects belong to everyone - problem is not everybody is a Ruby/Python/… expert
      * How do you handle so many projects?
      * If you create smaller teams with focus you are likelier to have less debt to think about
