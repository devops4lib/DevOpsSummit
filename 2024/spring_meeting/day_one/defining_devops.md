## Defining DevOps

### What is DevOps?
* Software developer couldn’t get things built, system admins tension
* Developers and Systems Admins coming together [When Sysadmins Ruled the Earth](craphound.com)
* Methodologies, tools, practices to work better together
* deployment of webapps ← Is this CI/CD?
* building empathy with people you don’t necessarily see directly
* A lot of automation
* Practices removing friction to deploy
* Blurring of line of responsibilities, don’t just hand off to someone else
    * Ops folks learning more about software dev, devs learning more about sys admin and deployment
* Systemization, processes that are repeatable and consistent
* Challenging the notion that developers “move ahead” and operations caring more about stability
* Moving away from operating in a vacuum -> so people don’t have individualized tools/preferred tools and can offer their specialized knowledge sets without knowing everything
* Systems thinking, optimization -> agreeing we are on the same team (Look at Russell L. Ackoff (Wharton Prof for guidance)
    * [Systems & Design Thinking: A Conceptual Framework for Their Intergration](https://repository.upenn.edu/handle/20.500.14332/41973) (topical article link)
    * [The Systems Thinker – A Lifetime of Systems Thinking - The Systems Thinker](https://thesystemsthinker.com/a-lifetime-of-systems-thinking/)
    * Great Book - [Idealized Design: How Bell Labs Imagined - and Created - the Telephone System of the Future - Knowledge at Wharton (upenn.edu)](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/podcast/knowledge-at-wharton-podcast/idealized-design-how-bell-labs-imagined-and-created-the-telephone-system-of-the-future/)
* Per Wikipedia, "DevOps integrates and automates the work of [software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development) (Dev) and [IT operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_operations) (Ops) as a means for improving and shortening the [systems development life cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle)."
* Cultural shift to a fluid process, not a punctuated process. Software and systems are active.
* A lot of growth in this area
* Clarifies definitions about the ontology of application architectures
* We grease wheels don’t crack whips
* What competencies does someone have to have to say they do devops?
* Built on the Intellectual Foundation of Systems Thinking (Forrester/ Ackoff/ Drucker)
* Not based on Tools
* Not one size to fit all
* Way to repeat it without fail.
* Social Ecology

### What is not DevOps?
* Manually SSH into server
* Hard to draw lines.
