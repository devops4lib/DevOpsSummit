## Staffing, Training, and Human Factors

Facilitator: Bess
Notes: Carla, Francis

  * initial sub-topics
      * Staffing shortage
      * Considering the human sides of DevOps (e.g., stress management)
      * Being New To Devops
      * ongoing training
  * creating DevOps training programs/materials
  * Basic devops training for developers
      * Done through the onboarding process
      * This is what we are actually doing. These are the things we are doing, this is what we are responsible
      * [Command line curriculum](https://github.com/pulibrary/command_line_curriculum) (at Princeton)
          * Used to train people in command line tools
          * Have people install applications manually in a non CI/CD way to show people the nuts and bolts of how things work and to show why we automate deployments
      * Find it valuable to know why you have to use Ansible
      * Using early career training is useful making other folks on the team develop their skills


  * Training at smaller institutions
      * Have to set aside time
      * A little bit all the time
      * Try stuff out locally before trying to scale it out to production/external deployments
      * DevOps is helpful after sinking a lot of time to try to get good processes and workflows
      * Installing software on your own and trying to understand it before doing more DevOps workflows
      * Writing and teaching a workshop is a way to learn a skill, then it’s also documented!
      * Documentation as training
  * Reducing cognitive load
      * Trying not to do too many things at the same time so it does not affect stress
  * Resource Options
      * [Carpentry programs](https://librarycarpentry.org/)
      * Linked in Learning workshops
  * What training doesn’t exist?
      * e.g. we created the solr workshop out of a lack of training here “How to do Solr” (these featured in early code4lib?)
      * The “next level up” materials are missing
  * There's a lot of different options for tooling in devops and its constantly changing so it’s hard to continue to training in different services and figure out how to put it together
      * Missing training in the intermediate and advance levels
  * Is the devops channel in Slack working?
      * There used to be a lot of conversation before the pandemic, but now there’s less on-going conversation and so it’s hard to jump in and ask questions
      * Monday (what are you doing this week) spark is no longer happening
  * It’s okay to try and not always succeed.
  * How to work with developers who struggle to learn new tools
  * Trying to convince developers to use best DevOps practices
      * Creating culture in management
      * [recommendation to read the phoenix project](https://itrevolution.com/product/the-phoenix-project/), have managers read this book
      * ensure you’re hiring for someone who wants to learn and collaborate, rather than the specific technical skills used on your team
  * What are some helpful practices?
  * [Pair programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pair-programming/) has been very helpful
  * you have to adopt the social / communal practices of
  * self-organizing teams
  * Saying who are
  * communicating up hierarchy when administration is giving work above capacity
  * start a meeting with a social moment: “just tell us anything” -- increases engagement in meetings
      * first we were doing a “how are you feeling” type checkin. ways to do this include number from 1=5 or a “weather report” analogy
  * managers need to set an example by only doing work inside work hours
  * schedule an email so it sends during work hours

  * Successful work life balance strategies
      * join a scheduled activity so I have to physically leave my house at the end of the work day
      * team culture to say on slack when you’re taking a walk, running an errand
      * However, I acknowledge the career advancement that I achieved due to working extra early in my career
      * Keep your schedule in check, if you work too many hours one day work less hours the next day
      * [Improve productivity with Microsoft Viva Insights](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-viva/insights)
      * Guaranteeing that systems will only be up during working hours
          * Getting people in the institutional hierarchy to agree to that is difficult
  * Demanding better working conditions
      * Not getting up at all hours to fix something
      * Library services aren’t life or death
          * Convincing people of this is true. 
  * Blameless Post Incident Meetings/Report
      * Working to establish this culture by stating the things I did that related to the incident, but shifting from that to a focus on the systematic issue
      * Stopped doing them because systems got to the point that they were so reliable
          * The times where it failed, it wasn’t part of the internal structure
          * All the right stuff was being done, to guarantee the best uptime possible
          * Still document when external errors happen, but they are no longer a large thing
      * Write incident reports when its an external failure, not a local one
      * Have a positive section (“when we got lucky”) to keep it positive and not all negative
      * Keep track of lessons learned
      * Template
          * How was the notification received?
          * What was the date, duration and business impact of the incident?
          * What was the root cause of the incident?
          * What other events or actions contributed to the incident’s severity or duration?
          * What immediate actions are being taken to minimize the causes recurring?
          * What long term action is required to reduce the frequency or effect of the root cause and contributing causes?  Indicate any barriers to pursuing these items.
          * Describe the technical steps that were taken: from initial detection of the failure, through identification of the problem, to restoration of service.
  * Is anyone tracking unplanned work?
      * When you are tracking it, its easier to advocate
      * Make work visible
      * Don’t do work without having a ticket
          * Why did it seem okay?
      * Need to have a culture of ticket/issue creation
      * Documenting work in tickets is an important visualization tools
      * Recognize that you’re addressing an issue of lack of trust in the institution
  * More visibility for the devops slack channel
      * Do people check it often? Yes
  * A method for reducing stress
      * Setting a pace
      * Setting the pomodoro timer
          * 25min minutes of work and then 5 minutes of break
          * Stay on the same task for 25minutes (used for people with ADHD)
