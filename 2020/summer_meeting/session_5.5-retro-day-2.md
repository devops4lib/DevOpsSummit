# Retro Day 2

Here we tried to retro things we didn't touch on in day 1

## Plus

* Improved acronym definitions
* Really strong topics and frank discussion
* Small group was conducive to conversations
* Moderation helped flow of conversation
* Learning about how powerful Last Pass Is
* Getting a richer appreciation for Hashicorp’s Vault
* Good flow of conversation with stacks
* Looking forward to continuing conversations
* + Today we seemed to have a better flow of conversations, so maybe the two stacks worked or maybe the topics were different? (may have also been the smaller group as noted elsewhere)

## Delta

* Broad discussions and info sharing is great (and my preference for most of our time), but there are topics like shared secrets that I think we’d benefit from deep dives into specific implementations
* Topics on Day 1 seemed to run over a bit. Topics on Day 2 seemed to run under. Perhaps time slots should get smaller after the first 3 sessions
* ++ So short! Is it really over for a whole ‘nother year?
* Will notes make it somewhere other than GoogleDocs?
* ++ Sorry I missed breakouts since we didn't have them today
* + I wish we could have talked more about Docker/Kubernetes
* Wish there were more topics covered?
* 2 stacks didn't seem to work very well.
* 45 min break instead of 30 min?
* Wish I could share recording of this, understand why not but some really strong descriptions of situations


## Retro discussion notes

Having two "fuller" days would have allowed us to cover more topics.
Combining the sessions even virtually does allow more perspectives.

## Moving Forward

* We have the mechanics set up for monthly discussions.
* Monthly discussion just needs to be coordinated. Francis has done this but it's on invited speakers to follow through.
* Could we do a series of "here's what we're doing please give me suggestions"
* Shrink the amount of time we ask a presenter to fill, and lengthen the time of Q&A, discussion.
* What about all the topics we didn't get to at this meeting? Can we schedule discussion-only monthly meetings?
* Add more process to weekly "what are you working on?" prompt? In order to leverage peoples' responses into meeting topics.
