# Retro Day 1

## Plus

* +++++ The stack
* ++ Seeing everyone, connecting; sense of camaraderie
* +++++ Using hand raise for discussion
* ++++ Social break-out rooms. Random breakout poker
* +++ Short breaks between talks
* Live editing contemporaneous notes
* Flexibility for attendees with Internet connectivity/other issues
* ++ Big Plus to note takers!
* Break timing
* + Social break outs
* + Simply everything. Great show again!
* +++++ Excellent facilitation! / moderation
* + I'm getting a lot out of this even though I'm sort of an interloper
* Anon Google Doc for Plus/Delta
* Great mix of new people / people who've attended before and ops / devs / librarians of other sorts


## Delta

* +++ I feel bad that we turned people away
* + I wish we somehow had two stacks, one for new topics and one to expand on the current topic
* Longer time for social break-out
* Potential topics for social break-out
* Not being able to happy hour / dinner / hang out together. Breakout room was good, but no real substitute. Obvi, the best we could do under the circumstances, tho.
* Format does lose some of the flexibility of the live discussion, though we obviously did not have a choice this year
* Shorter Day (i.e. wished for a longer day)
  * Curious what would be some possible suggestions for a virtual environment. Like more days but shorter?
  * Sad to have to work before and/or after
* More use of the chat for sharing of links.
* + I feel bad that I took a spot that some devops person couldn't get
* +++ Lack of dedicated gatekeeper role like prior years
* Google Docs limiting us to 10 editors
* Not enough interlopers

## Discussion notes

* Re: turning people away: people limited registration from their institutions 
* 2 stacks: We will try tomorrow.
* Shorter day
  * Everything needed to be compressed because of time zones.
  * Are we truly national / international? How wide can we aspire open up this event?
  * We could host another one
* Gatekeeper: use a symbol?
  * Maybe this was sufficiently addressed and we don't need to add more complexity here.
* Re: Google Docs, I wonder if EtherPad might be a way around the googledoc limits
  * unfortunately EtherPad shut down
